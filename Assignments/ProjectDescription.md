## Project Abstract
The general project focus is a Computer Science based project where a web application will be created. This application will utilize data analytics and visualization to take API data from various stock markets and other commodities. This data will be shown and interpreted in a way that can be used to track the trajectory of the price of these assets in real time. The end user will have the capability of viewing a desired ticker symbol of a stock or commodity. They can then utilize drawing tools and indicators to form possible investment strategies. Users will also have the ability to create a watch list and a portfolio in order to monitor price changes.

## Project Goal Statement
To create a web based application that will utilize data analytics and visualization where API data will be taken from various stock markets and other commodities. This data will be shown and interpreted in a way that can be used to track the trajectory of the price of these assets in current and historical time. 

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to allow the end user to monitor the price of various stocks and commodities. The user will be able to utilize the tools provided within the web application to make their own decisions in regards to investing, trading, and economics.
