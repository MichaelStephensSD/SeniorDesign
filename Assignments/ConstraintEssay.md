# Major Project Constraints

## Economic

There is a financial limitation to the solution of this project. The data for stocks and commodities will be pulled solely from free API database sources. This data likely will not be as up to date or as accurate as paid data. The project will rely completely on free software and there will be no budget put towards paid services. This ultimately will limit the capabilities of the web application and real time data interpretation potential.

## Social

This project will have a benefit for society. The web application will allow users to monitor real time data for stocks and commodities. The end user can choose to use this data to make their own educated decisions on their potential investments or trading strategies. A user will have the capability to monitor their personal investment portfolios. This may improve the quality and efficiency of their life by providing convenient data all in one place. However, the end user is limited to how accurate the data may be and whether or not this platform is deemed to be more useful than its possible competitors.

## Time

The project will inevitably have a time constraint based on the project deadlines and timeline. The project must be completed within the allotted time. Since there is only one individual working on the project, time management will be paramount for the completion of each major project milestone. The scope and betterment of the project will ultimately be limited due to the time constraint. The quality of work will be dedicated toward the completion of the major milestones and the smaller tasks laid out in the timeline will be prioritized slightly less. Everything aligned within the timeline will rely on proper time management for quality assurance due to the short allotted project time.
