Justification of Work:

As the sole member of this project, I took on all the responsibilities from start to finish. During the Fall 2022 semester, I focused on completing senior design class assignments, brainstorming ideas, planning the project, and conducting thorough research on the topic. In the Spring 2023 semester, my efforts were directed towards finishing class assignments, developing and implementing the project, testing and debugging it, and documenting my work. Additionally, I designed the Final Expo Poster and prepared for the presentation and demo. I spent a total of 150 hours on the project, which is justified by the wide range of tasks I tackled and my consistent dedication to delivering high-quality work throughout the entire process.
