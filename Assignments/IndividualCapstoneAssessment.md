# Michael Stephens - Individual Capstone Assessment

The goal of my Computer Science Senior Design project is to demonstrate the
competency of the collective knowledge and skills that I have acquired amongst my
extensive course load. From my unique individual academic perspective the project
is about taking what I have learned from the curriculum and coming up with an
isolated task that will prove my ability and application of various Computer Science
related skills. I will create something that both peaks my interest and allows me to
express the unique abilities that I have gained as an individual throughout my college
experience. I look forward to putting my skills to the test. This is something that will
allow me to reflect on what I have learned and prepare for the future.

Throughout my college computer science curriculum I have acquired many
different skill sets through a large variety of course work and challenges. I have
learned how to work both alone and in a team oriented environment. I have learned
how to effectively manage my time in order to complete project based work. Skills
such as algorithms, data structures, programming languages, cyber security, cloud
computing were all acquired throughout my college curriculum. My course work
provided me with experience with several programming languages including: Python,
C++, Java, HTML/CSS, SQL, Solidity, Matlab, VBA. All of these skills I have
acquired will help guide and support me with the development of my Computer
Science senior design project.

From all of my different Co-op experiences I developed many different job
oriented and individual technical skills. From my experiential exploration program
within my first Co-op I developed skills in both blockchain and python programming
by taking several online courses. Within my second experiential exploration Co-op I
completed a course dealing a wide range of skills including: software testing and
automation, computer architecture and algorithm specialisation. During my most
recent Co-op with Cenovus Energy I also learned a large variety of applicable
knowledge and skill sets. These include but are not limited to: managing large data
sets, configure servers and networking skills, cyber security oriented skills.

In continuation, the main motivation for the project is to take the most
interesting parts of what I have learned throughout my college curriculum including
the Co-ops and come up with a unique project design that demonstrates a unique
skill set of what I find the most interesting. I am motivated to work on this project
because it is finally something that I get to work on that isn't entirely predetermined
and is much more of a creative oriented project than that of the majority of the
college curriculum. My approach to this project is to design a web application that will
be used to graph large sets of data in real time. This data will be pulled from many
different stock exchanges using API. I would like to come up with a unique solution
to manipulate the data in order to create a unique application that can be used for
data analysis that is unlike that of other platforms.

In order to self-evaluate my contributions I will constantly keep note of how
much time and deep work I am dedicating to the project. I will not be satisfied with
the project unless I truly know that I have given it my all. Once I am done with a
specific task I will go back and evaluate to see if there are any changes that can be
made inforder to make the project better. This is a sure method for how I will know
whether or not I have done a good job. I will know when I am done when I come to a
sure conclusion that there is nothing that I feel needs further improvement and the
time and thought put into a given task is adequate.
